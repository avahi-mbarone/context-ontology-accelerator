"""Guard the two-phase split that makes the context-manager integ suite `-n`-safe.

`pytest -n 8 --dist loadfile` keeps one file's tests on one worker but still runs
DIFFERENT files concurrently. A test that mutates state ambient to the whole suite
— the integ user's grants — therefore sits inside other files' query windows:
`test_email_keyed_grant_enforcement_integ.py` holds a deny-all grant on the shared
knowledge namespace, and in job 9539493 it passed on gw5 while
`test_tier2_strategies.py` failed on gw4 with `AccessDeniedError` two seconds later.

The fix is a marker plus a serial second phase in CI. Both halves are load-bearing
and neither is self-evident from reading either file alone, so they are pinned here.
The failure this most guards against is not a red pipeline but a GREEN one: get the
two `-m` expressions wrong and the excluded tests simply never run.

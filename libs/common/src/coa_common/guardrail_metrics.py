"""Guardrail allow/block observability — CloudWatch metrics + structured decision log.

One helper for every site that decides a guardrail outcome (issue #111, AC10/AC11).
Emits three metrics under ``COA/Guardrails``:

* ``GuardrailInvocations`` (Count) — every decision, allow or block.
* ``GuardrailBlocked`` (Count) — 1 only when the guardrail intervened with a block.
* ``GuardrailLatency`` (Milliseconds) — wall-clock of the guarded call.

Block *rate* is deliberately NOT emitted: it is a CloudWatch math expression
over the two counters, so publishing it would be a third source of truth.

Two transports, because the callers run on different compute:

* ``transport="put"`` — explicit ``PutMetricData``, used by the ECS Fargate
  tasks (kg-build, enrichment, ontology). Not a constraint: ``awsLogs`` writes
  through ``PutLogEvents`` and CloudWatch Logs *does* extract Embedded Metric
  Format from those events. It is a choice — these containers already publish
  their other custom metrics (cost, stage durations) via ``PutMetricData``, and
  keeping the decision metric off the log pipeline means it does not depend on
  a JSON line surviving a stdout stream shared with human-readable logs, nor
  carry per-log-event ingestion cost for every guardrail call. Needs a
  ``cloudwatch:PutMetricData`` grant conditioned on the metric namespace.
* ``transport="emf"`` — stdout EMF via :func:`coa_common.metrics.emit_metric`.
  No IAM grant and no API latency on the request path, at the cost of log
  ingestion. Used by the serve path, which already emits its other metrics
  this way.

Nothing here may raise into a guardrail decision: a blocked-content path that
fails because telemetry broke would be a security regression. Every entry point
swallows its own exceptions.

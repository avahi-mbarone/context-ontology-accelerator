"""``AossVectorClient`` — the shared AOSS vector client.

See the package docstring (``coa_common.opensearch``) for the
engine/filtering contract and the AOSS quirks this client encapsulates.

The client is transport-pluggable:

- **direct** (default): a SigV4-signed opensearch-py client, live credentials,
  full data plane (create / bulk / search / count / delete). Used by
  ontology-engine and metric-service.
- **proxy**: a caller-supplied ``transport`` callable that executes a *search*
  body elsewhere (e.g. the serve AgentCore search-proxy Lambda). Search/count
  only; write/index-admin ops raise. Used by the serve retrieval tiers.

Filtering is always server-side: :meth:`knn_search` and :meth:`count` build a
``bool``/``filter`` from the given ``term``/``exists`` clauses and push it into
the k-NN query (or a plain count query).

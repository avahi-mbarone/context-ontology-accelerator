"""Shared retry/timeout policy for outbound clients.

Single source of truth for the retry and socket-timeout configuration applied
to AWS SDK (boto3) clients and non-boto3 HTTP clients, per Amazon's
Timeouts/Retries/Jitter best practices:
https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Services/TimeoutsAndRetries

- Synchronous customer-path calls fail fast and retry at most once.
- Asynchronous/background calls use capped exponential backoff with jitter.

botocore's ``standard`` retry mode natively implements capped exponential
backoff with full jitter plus a retry token bucket, so we express both presets
through it rather than hand-rolling backoff.

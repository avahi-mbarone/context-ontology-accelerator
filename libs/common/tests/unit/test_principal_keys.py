"""Unit tests for the shared principal-key sanitizer.

This helper is the single source of truth for encoding principal identifiers
into DynamoDB key components. Every writer (grant handlers) and reader (API
authorizer, serve-layer role resolver) depends on it producing identical
output, so these tests pin the exact encoding contract.

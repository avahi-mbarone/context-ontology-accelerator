"""AI review of a pull request — code review and docs-completeness review.

Replaces the internally-hosted review CI components for the GitHub repository.
Maintainer-invoked: takes a PR number or URL, reads the diff, asks Claude via
Bedrock for findings, and posts them as a single review comment using the same
severity markers the ``github-pr-review`` resolver skill triages — so a finding
filed here can be resolved by that skill without translation.

Safety properties, in order of importance:

1. **Maintainer-gated.** ``workflow_dispatch`` already requires write access, but
   the actor's permission is re-checked here so the gate is explicit and survives
   someone adding a second trigger later.
2. **The diff is untrusted.** A pull request author controls it completely. It is
   passed to the model as delimited data, never interpolated into a shell
   command, and the prompts state that the block is data and not instructions.
3. **Findings are advisory.** This posts a comment. It does not approve, request
   changes, merge, or push code, so a manipulated model response cannot alter
   the repository state.
4. **Reasoning and writing are separate jobs.** ``--mode reason`` holds the model
   credentials and NO write permission; it emits a JSON payload. ``--mode
   publish`` holds write permission and never touches the model. The payload is
   the audited handoff between them, so a compromised model response cannot
   reach a token that can write.
5. **Model output is scanned before posting.** Credential shapes and internal
   hostnames are redacted, because the model reads a full diff and its output
   goes to a public comment.
6. **Fork-authored content is refused.** Reviewing it would process untrusted
   content while holding privileged credentials.

"""Guard for the shared bedrock-runtime client's connection-pool cap.

The rerank ThreadPool (pipeline.py, _grounding_workers default 24) has ALL its
threads share ONE lazily-built bedrock-runtime client. botocore's default
``max_pool_connections=10`` throttles a multi-threaded pool. This locks that the
client is built with a pool cap that is >= the worker default so no rerank
thread starves on a connection.

"""Unit tests for count_active_jobs in induce_catalog.py.

Backs the namespace-deletion precondition check (control-plane
delete_handler._check_active_induction_jobs) — counts three independent
sources of in-flight background work against a namespace's ontology data:
  - induction jobs (structured + unstructured) not yet terminal
  - async ontology-ingest jobs (upload-a-custom-ontology-file) not yet
    terminal
  - proposals currently in the "accepting" state (background ingest writer
    in flight)

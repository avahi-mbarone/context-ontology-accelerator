"""T-Box axiom induction from a graphrag-toolkit lexical knowledge graph.

This module implements the induction rules that convert the lexical
graph's class distribution, sampled entities, facts, and topics into
formal OWL/RDF axioms. Each rule produces an :class:`rdflib.Graph`
fragment; the pipeline orchestrator merges these fragments and the
serializer emits final Turtle.

This file currently implements **Rule 1 only** (Task 12.1, Requirement
10): map distinct entity classifications to ``owl:Class`` declarations.
Rules 2–6 (named individuals, object/datatype properties, concepts,
provenance) are scoped to subsequent tasks (12.2–12.6).

Inputs to Rule 1
----------------

- ``class_distribution``: :class:`ClassRecord` list from
  :meth:`LexicalGraphStore.get_class_nodes`. The ``value`` field is the
  class label as it appears in the ``__SYS_Class__`` node — typically
  CamelCase (e.g. ``"FinancialInstrument"``).
- ``descriptions``: mapping from class label (in the form used upstream
  by the description generator and class normalizer — i.e. the
  space-separated entity-class form, e.g. ``"Financial Instrument"``)
  to the generated ``rdfs:comment`` text (Requirement 4).
- ``normalizer_results``: mapping from the same space-separated class
  label to the :class:`NormalizationResult` produced by the class
  normalizer (Requirement 9). Drives IRI minting (or reuse) and
  ``skos:closeMatch`` link creation.
- ``iri_resolver``: an :class:`IRIResolver` for minting deterministic
  class IRIs.
- ``floor``: minimum ``ClassRecord.count`` for a class to be included
  (Requirement 3.4 / Requirement 10.1, default 3).

Per-class behaviour
-------------------

For each :class:`ClassRecord` whose ``count >= floor``:

1. Find its ``NormalizationResult``. The ``class_iri`` field of that
   result is the IRI to use:
   - For band ``exact`` it's the existing matched IRI (Req 9.3).
   - For band ``close_match`` it's a freshly-minted IRI; the function
     additionally emits ``<new_iri> skos:closeMatch <matched_iri>``
     (Req 9.4).
   - For band ``novel`` it's a freshly-minted IRI with no link
     (Req 9.5).
   The IRI shape for class IRIs is
   ``http://coa.amazon.com/namespace/{ns}/ontology/{name}/class/{normalized-label}``
   — note the literal ``class`` segment (Req 10.2). This disambiguates
   T-Box class IRIs from A-Box individual IRIs when an entity is
   literally named after its class.
2. Emit ``<class_iri> rdf:type owl:Class`` (Req 10.1).
3. Emit ``<class_iri> rdfs:label "<original ClassRecord.value>"^^xsd:string``
   (Req 10.3 — preserves the CamelCase form from ``__SYS_Class__``).
4. Emit ``<class_iri> rdfs:comment "<description>"^^xsd:string``
   (Req 10.4) when a description is available.

Edge cases
----------

- ``count < floor``: skip silently. The sampler/distribution caller is
  responsible for the observability of the threshold.
- ``count >= floor`` but no description and no normalizer result for
  this class: skip with a WARNING log naming the class. The pipeline
  should arrive here only when both maps are populated, so this is a
  defensive guard.
- ``count >= floor`` and normalizer result present but description
  missing: emit the class declaration with ``rdfs:label`` only. This is
  graceful degradation when the description generator legitimately
  fell back (e.g. zero-entity classes use the deterministic
  ``"Class representing N entities including: ..."`` fallback) — the
  point is the class is still a real class.
- Zero classes pass the floor: return an empty graph and log a single
  WARNING (Req 10.5).

Determinism
-----------

Iteration follows the natural order of ``class_distribution``. rdflib
graphs are unordered conceptually, but the per-class log lines use
this ordering to make runs visually comparable.

# treats them as optional because the pipeline's primary value is the
# T-Box (class + property declarations).

    """Induce ``owl:NamedIndividual`` declarations from sampled entities.

    Implements Rule 2 (Requirement 11): when ``include_individuals=True``,
    every sampled entity becomes an ``owl:NamedIndividual`` with three
    triples — declaration, class typing, and ``rdfs:label``. When
    ``include_individuals=False`` (the default), this function is a
    no-op that returns an empty graph.

    Per-entity behaviour (when ``include_individuals=True``):

    1. Look up the ``owl:Class`` IRI for the entity's classification
       in ``class_iris``. If the class isn't known (e.g. it was below
       the floor threshold in Rule 1), skip the entity with a WARNING
       (Req 11.5).
    2. Mint the individual's IRI via
       ``iri_resolver.resolve(entity.value, entity.classification)``
       (Req 11.2). Per the convention documented in Req 10.2, A-Box
       individual IRIs use the entity's class label as the
       classification slot — NOT the literal ``"class"`` token used
       for T-Box class IRIs. So an entity ``value="Apple",
       classification="Company"`` mints
       ``.../namespace/{ns}/ontology/{name}/Company/Apple`` and is
       cleanly distinguished from the class IRI ``.../class/Company``.
    3. Emit ``<individual_iri> rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual`` (Req 11.1).
    4. Emit ``<individual_iri> rdf:type <class_iri>`` (Req 11.3).
    5. Emit ``<individual_iri> rdfs:label <entity.value>^^xsd:string``
       (Req 11.4).

    On any per-entity failure (resolver exception, missing class IRI),
    the entity is skipped with a WARNING and the rest of the batch
    continues. Programmer errors propagate.

    Args:
        sampled_entities: List of :class:`EntityRecord`. Typically the
            flat union of every class's sampled entities (the orchestrator
            constructs this from the ``Stratified_Sampler`` output).
        class_iris: Mapping from class label (space-separated form, e.g.
            ``"Financial Instrument"``) to the ``owl:Class`` IRI minted
            by Rule 1. Used to look up the type assertion target.
        iri_resolver: An :class:`IRIResolver` for minting deterministic
            individual IRIs.
        include_individuals: Gate flag (Req 11.6). Defaults to ``False``;
            when ``False`` the function returns an empty graph and emits
            a single INFO log line. When ``True`` the rule actually runs.

        (declaration, class typing, label) plus the standard prefix

    to populate exactly one).

def induce_object_properties(

    """Induce ``owl:ObjectProperty`` declarations from SPO facts.

    Implements Rule 3 (Requirement 12, Task 12D-amended). Aggregates
    SPO facts by ``(normalized_predicate, subject_class)`` and emits
    one ``owl:ObjectProperty`` per distinct aggregation key. Each
    property has exactly ONE ``rdfs:domain`` triple (the subject
    class) and one or more ``rdfs:range`` triples (one per distinct
    object class observed within the aggregation).

    The change from the original Rule 3 contract: the same predicate
    spelled identically across two different subject classes used to
    collapse into a single property with multiple ``rdfs:domain``
    triples (which OWL formally interprets as the intersection of
    those classes — usually empty). After Task 12D, ``Person.works_for``
    and ``Library.owns`` are distinct properties from ``Vehicle.owns``,
    matching the structured-induction strategy's per-(table, column)
    convention. See ``OntologyDevelopmentNotes/iri-minting-discussion.md``
    for the full reasoning.

    Per aggregation key the function emits:

    - one ``rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty`` declaration (Req 12.1)
    - exactly one ``rdfs:domain`` triple (Req 12.3 — the subject class)
    - one ``rdfs:range`` triple per distinct object class observed
      within this aggregation key (Req 12.4 — range fan-out within a
      single subject class is allowed and reflects genuine relational
      ambiguity that the entailment engine can refine)
    - one ``rdfs:label`` whose value is the canonical-by-frequency
      original predicate string within this aggregation key
      (Req 12.6 / Req 19.3, applied per-key — not pooled across
      subject classes)

    The property IRI is minted via
    ``iri_resolver.resolve(normalized_predicate, f"{subject_class}/ObjectProperty")``
    (Req 12.2). The resulting IRI shape is
    ``{prefix}/{Subject-Class}/ObjectProperty/{normalized_predicate}``
    where the subject class slot is normalized via the resolver's
    case-preserving Pattern-1 rules (so ``"Financial Instrument"``
    becomes ``"Financial-Instrument"``).

    Cross-(predicate, class) equivalence (Req 12.5):

    - Distinct aggregation keys produce distinct property IRIs by
      default. The optional Task 12B.2 property normalizer can
      detect when two distinct IRIs are semantically equivalent and
      emit ``owl:equivalentProperty`` axioms linking them. Without
      a property normalizer, distinct keys remain unlinked.

    Per-fact filtering (Req 12.7):

    - If either ``subject_class`` or ``object_class`` has no entry in
      ``class_iris`` (i.e. that class was below the floor threshold
      in Rule 1), the fact is skipped silently — it cannot contribute
      a meaningful domain or range constraint.

    The IRI resolver's ``resolve()`` method takes a single
    ``classification`` slot. We want the slot to be
    ``<subject_class>/<kind>`` (e.g. ``Company/DatatypeProperty``) so
    the final IRI groups by class first and kind second — matching
    the linked-data convention that all of a class's related
    resources (the class itself, its individuals, and its properties)
    share a common ``.../<Subject-Class>/...`` path prefix. The kind
    discriminator (``ObjectProperty`` / ``DatatypeProperty``) lives
    underneath the class segment.

    The default resolver percent-encodes any slash inside the
    classification value, producing a single-segment slot like
    ``Company%2FDatatypeProperty`` — correct IRI but ugly.

    This helper post-processes the resolver's output: it replaces the
    percent-encoded slash with a literal slash so the IRI reads as
    intended. This is safe because we control both halves of the
    classification slot (they're class label + kind token), so the
    only ``%2F`` in the slot ever comes from our intentional join.
    The case-folded lookup-key invariant is preserved because we
    always call ``resolve`` with the same composite slot string for
    a given ``(subject_class, kind)`` pair, so subsequent lookups
    return the same minted IRI.

    Args:
        iri_resolver: The :class:`IRIResolver` to mint via.
        normalized: The normalized predicate string (per Req 19.1),

# ``rdfs:domain`` enumerates every subject class observed and whose
# ``rdfs:range`` is the XSD type inferred from all complement values
# (unanimous → that type, mixed → ``xsd:string``).

    """Induce ``owl:DatatypeProperty`` declarations from SPC facts.

    Implements Rule 4 (Requirement 13, Task 12D-amended). Aggregates
    SPC facts by ``(normalized_predicate, subject_class)`` and emits
    one ``owl:DatatypeProperty`` per distinct aggregation key. Each
    property has exactly ONE ``rdfs:domain`` triple (the subject
    class) and ONE ``rdfs:range`` triple (the XSD type inferred from
    the complement values within this aggregation key — i.e. per-class
    inference, NOT pooled across subject classes).

    The change from the original Rule 4 contract: the same predicate
    spelled identically across two different subject classes used to
    collapse into a single property with multiple ``rdfs:domain``
    triples and a pooled XSD inference. After Task 12D,
    ``Vehicle.weight`` (in tons) and ``Person.weight`` (in kg) are
    distinct properties, each with its own domain and per-class XSD
    range. See ``OntologyDevelopmentNotes/iri-minting-discussion.md``
    for the full reasoning.

    Per aggregation key the function emits:

    - one ``rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty`` declaration (Req 13.2)
    - exactly one ``rdfs:domain`` triple (Req 13.4 — the subject class)
    - exactly one ``rdfs:range`` triple with the XSD type inferred
      from this aggregation key's complement values (Req 13.5, see
      Req 18)
    - one ``rdfs:label`` whose value is the canonical-by-frequency
      original predicate string within this aggregation key
      (Req 13.7 / Req 19.3, applied per-key — not pooled across
      subject classes)
    - one ``rdfs:comment`` summarizing observation frequency on this
      single subject class (Req 13.8)

    The property IRI is minted via
    ``iri_resolver.resolve(normalized_predicate, f"{subject_class}/DatatypeProperty")``
    (Req 13.3). The resulting IRI shape is
    ``{prefix}/{Subject-Class}/DatatypeProperty/{normalized_predicate}``.

    Cross-(predicate, class) equivalence (Req 13.6):

    - Distinct aggregation keys produce distinct property IRIs by
      default. The optional Task 12B.2 property normalizer can
      detect when two distinct IRIs are semantically equivalent and
      emit ``owl:equivalentProperty`` axioms linking them.

    Per-fact filtering (Req 13.9):

    - SPO facts (object_value populated) are silently filtered out by
      ``_is_spc_fact``; Rule 3 will handle them.
    - Facts whose ``subject_class`` has no entry in ``class_iris``
      (i.e. that class was below the floor threshold in Rule 1) are
      skipped silently.
    - A predicate that normalizes to the empty string is logged at
      WARNING and skipped.
    - If ALL facts for a given aggregation key are skipped, no
      property declaration is emitted for that key.

    XSD range inference (Req 18):

    - Within each aggregation key, every contributing fact's
      complement value is inspected via ``infer_xsd_type``. The
      result is a single XSD type:
        - unanimous across all values for this key → that type
        - mixed → ``xsd:string``
        - empty list → ``xsd:string``

    Same-predicate dual emission (Object/Datatype):

    If the same normalized predicate appears in BOTH SPO and SPC
    facts on the same subject class, Rule 3 emits an
    ``owl:ObjectProperty`` and Rule 4 emits an ``owl:DatatypeProperty``
    at DIFFERENT IRIs (the kind segment differs:
    ``ObjectProperty/<class>`` vs ``DatatypeProperty/<class>``).
    A downstream reviewer can merge them via ``owl:equivalentProperty``
    if desired.

    Per-key fault isolation: a resolver failure for one aggregation
    key logs a WARNING and skips just that key; the rest of the
    batch continues. Empty inputs return an empty graph.

    Args:
        facts: List of :class:`FactRecord`. Both SPO and SPC may be

# ── Rule 5 — __Topic__ nodes → skos:Concept (T-Box) ────────────────────
#
# Implements Task 12.5 / Requirement 14. Topics in the lexical graph
# are thematic groupings of statements (e.g. ``"Financial Holdings
# Summary"``, ``"Legal Proceedings and Litigation"``). Each topic
# becomes a ``skos:Concept`` and all concepts are linked via
# ``skos:inScheme`` to a single ``skos:ConceptScheme`` per pipeline
# run.
#
# Why SKOS and not OWL? Topics are not classes — they are *labels*
# applied to chunks of source text. SKOS is the W3C-standard vocabulary
# for "lightweight" knowledge organization (taxonomies, thesauri,
# subject classification). Using ``skos:Concept`` rather than
# ``owl:Class`` keeps the T-Box clean: classes describe what entities
# *are*; concepts describe what entities are *about*. A reasoner over
# this ontology won't accidentally infer that an ``Apple`` (the
# Company) is-a ``Financial Holdings Summary`` — it will see two
# disjoint semantic worlds joined only by application-level metadata
# (e.g. ``dcterms:subject``) which Rule 6 may add later.


def induce_concepts(
    topics: list[TopicRecord],
    iri_resolver: IRIResolver,
    namespace_name: str,
) -> Graph:
    """Induce ``skos:Concept`` declarations from ``__Topic__`` nodes.

    Implements Rule 5 (Requirement 14): every ``__Topic__`` with a
    non-empty ``value`` becomes one ``skos:Concept`` typed and labelled
    via ``skos:prefLabel``. All concepts are linked to a single
    ``skos:ConceptScheme`` (one per pipeline run) via ``skos:inScheme``.

    Per topic the function emits:

    - one ``rdf:type skos:Concept`` declaration (Req 14.1)
    - one ``skos:prefLabel`` with the topic's ``value`` as
      ``xsd:string`` (Req 14.3)
    - one ``skos:inScheme`` linking the concept to the run's
      ``skos:ConceptScheme`` (Req 14.4)

    Per pipeline run the function emits exactly one
    ``skos:ConceptScheme`` block (Req 14.4 / Req 14.5):

    - ``rdf:type skos:ConceptScheme`` declaration
    - ``rdfs:label`` of the form ``"{namespace_name} Topic Scheme"``
      with ``xsd:string`` datatype

    The concept IRI is minted via
    ``iri_resolver.resolve(topic.value, "Topic")`` (Req 14.2),
    producing IRIs of shape
    ``{prefix}/Topic/{normalized-topic-value}``. The classification
    slot is the literal token ``"Topic"`` — topics are global concepts
    (members of a single ``ConceptScheme``), not per-class entities,
    so the slot does NOT include a class qualifier. This is the same
    asymmetry as the ``"class"`` literal used for ``owl:Class`` IRIs
    (Req 10.2).

    The ConceptScheme IRI is minted via
    ``iri_resolver.resolve(namespace_name, "ConceptScheme")``,
    producing an IRI like
    ``{prefix}/ConceptScheme/{normalized-namespace-name}``.

    Per-topic filtering (Req 14.6):

    - Topics whose ``value`` is empty or whitespace-only are skipped
      with a WARNING log including the topic's ``topic_id``. They
      cannot have a meaningful ``skos:prefLabel`` and the resolver
      would refuse to mint an empty-segment IRI.
    - Topics whose ``value`` normalizes to empty (e.g. only
      special characters) cause the resolver to raise; the function
      catches the resolver error and skips the topic with a WARNING.
    - The ConceptScheme is emitted regardless — even if every topic
      is skipped, the scheme is a valid pipeline artifact (a future
      run may add concepts to it via Task 12B.x cross-run reuse).

    Per-topic fault isolation: a resolver failure on one topic logs
    a WARNING and skips just that topic; the rest of the batch
    continues. Programmer errors (TypeError, ImportError) propagate.

    Args:
        topics: List of :class:`TopicRecord` from
            :meth:`LexicalGraphStore.get_topics`. Each has a
            ``topic_id``, ``value``, and ``statement_count``. The
            ``statement_count`` is informational only — Rule 5 does
            not filter on it (a topic with zero statements is still
            a valid concept; whether to filter is the orchestrator's
            concern).
        iri_resolver: An :class:`IRIResolver` for minting deterministic
            concept and ConceptScheme IRIs.
        namespace_name: The pipeline's namespace name (e.g.
            ``"my-graph"``). Used to build the ConceptScheme IRI and
            its ``rdfs:label`` (``"{namespace_name} Topic Scheme"``).

    Returns:
        An :class:`rdflib.Graph` containing:
          - one ``skos:ConceptScheme`` declaration (always emitted)
          - three triples per emitted concept (declaration, prefLabel,
            inScheme)
        plus the standard prefix bindings. Empty if ``namespace_name``
        is empty (we cannot mint the scheme without it).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``namespace_name`` is empty or None — the
            ConceptScheme cannot be minted without it. Topics that
            individually fail to mint are logged and skipped; the
            scheme-level error is fatal because there's nothing
            sensible to return.

"""Class description generator for T-Box ``rdfs:comment`` annotations.

Given a mapping of classification string → list of sampled entity surface-form
labels, this module synthesizes a concise 1-3 sentence natural-language
description of each class via an LLM. The descriptions are intended to be
attached as ``rdfs:comment`` annotations on the corresponding ``owl:Class``
declarations, replacing the primitive ``"Source entity count: N"`` format.

The LLM client is typed structurally via the ``LLMDescriptionClient``
``Protocol`` so the function can be tested with a simple mock. The existing
``LLMClient`` from ``coa_ontology.inducer.services.llm`` satisfies
this protocol structurally — its ``generate(prompt, system, max_tokens) -> str``
signature matches by definition. This module deliberately does NOT import the
concrete ``LLMClient`` class to avoid coupling the service to the Bedrock
implementation.

Each class is processed independently: a per-class LLM failure (any exception
raised by ``generate``) is caught, logged at WARNING level, and replaced with
a deterministic fallback description of the form::

    "Class representing {N} entities including: {top-5-alphabetical-labels}"

where the top-5 labels are the lexicographically smallest five (case-insensitive
ordering via ``str.casefold``), joined by ``", "``. If fewer than five labels
are available, all of them are listed; if zero, the trailing list is empty.

Classes whose label list is empty bypass the LLM entirely and use the fallback
directly to avoid wasting a request on a hallucinated description.

Usage::

    from coa_ontology.inducer.unstructured.services.description_generator import (
        generate_descriptions,
    )

    class_entities = {
        "Financial Instrument": ["Treasury Bond", "Corporate Note", "Equity Swap"],
        "Company": ["Acme Corp", "Globex", "Initech"],
    }
    descriptions = generate_descriptions(class_entities, llm_client)
    # descriptions: {"Financial Instrument": "Financial instruments ...", ...}

# essentially just the entity surface forms — which means the LLM tends to
# fall back on its parametric memory ("a Company is a business
# organization...") rather than describing what the SPECIFIC graph
# instance actually contains. The enriched-context mode pairs each entity
# label with one or more short context strings (typically derived from
# ``__Fact__`` nodes) so the LLM has direct evidence of how the entities
# behave in this graph.
#
# The enriched API is a separate function (not a flag on
# ``generate_descriptions``) because the input shape is fundamentally
# different — a richer dict-of-list-of-records vs. a simple
# dict-of-list-of-strings. The pipeline orchestrator can choose which
# function to call based on its configuration; both share the same fallback,
# post-processing, and per-class fault-isolation semantics.

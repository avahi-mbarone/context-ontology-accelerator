"""Foundational grounding for unstructured-induced classes.

The unstructured (lexical-graph) induction pipeline mints one ``owl:Class``
per distinct source classification and, in Stage 4, dedupes those classes
against each OTHER within the run (``class_normalizer``). It does NOT, on its
own, align them to the namespace's loaded foundational ontologies (FIBO,
Schema.org, uploaded ontologies, …).

This module adds that alignment by reusing the shared, strategy-agnostic
:class:`~coa_ontology.inducer.services.grounding.GroundingService`
— the exact same recall → exact-name → LLM-rerank pipeline the structured
``table_to_ontology`` strategy uses — via its :meth:`ground_class` entry point.

Given the per-class ``(label, description, embedding vector)`` the pipeline
already computes, :func:`ground_classes` produces a graph of grounding axioms
that MERGE into the induced graph, mirroring the structured emission:

- ``<class> rdfs:subClassOf <foundational>``       (grounded: exact/high-conf)
- ``<class> skos:exactMatch  <foundational>``      (match_type == "exact")
- ``<class> skos:closeMatch  <foundational>``      (match_type == "high_confidence")
- ``<class> skos:relatedMatch <foundational>``     (match_type == "ambiguous")
- ``<class> <ns>matchConfidence "<score>"^^xsd:float``  (annotation)

Design notes:

- **Additive only.** This emits a SEPARATE graph that the pipeline unions
  into the main graph. The within-run ``skos:closeMatch`` links emitted by
  Rule 1 (``induce_classes``) are untouched — those are class↔class dedupe
  links; these are class↔foundational grounding links.
- **Fail-open for per-class faults, fail-loud for rerank infra failures.** A
  genuine per-class error (bad vector, programming bug) is caught and logged and
  that class is left un-grounded (novel), never failing the whole run. But a
  ``GroundingRerankError`` (LLM rerank infrastructure failure — Bedrock error
  after retries, truncated/blocked stopReason, unparseable output) is re-raised
  so the job fails loud instead of silently grounding every class novel — the
  documented fail-loud guarantee (issue #59), matching the structured path.
- **No-op when disabled.** Empty/None ``ontology_ids`` or a ``None`` service
  → returns an empty graph and the pipeline behaves exactly as pre-grounding.

"""Abstract interface for the lexical graph store.

This is a thin, typed Protocol that all lexical graph backends implement.
It covers the subset of operations the unstructured induction pipeline
uses to read class/entity/fact/topic data from a graphrag-toolkit
lexical knowledge graph.

Follows the same pattern as ``stores/base.py``:
  - runtime-checkable Protocol class
  - typed method signatures
  - dataclass record types for structured returns

Two golden rules:
  1. If a caller needs backend-specific behaviour, it talks to the
     concrete backend, not through this Protocol.
  2. Method names reflect the lexical graph domain model
     (__SYS_Class__, __Entity__, __Fact__, __Topic__).

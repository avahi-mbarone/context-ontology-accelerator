    The ``generate`` method is synchronous: the underlying

    ``async def`` would block whatever event loop awaits it without
    gaining any concurrency. Callers that need background execution
    should schedule the call via a thread pool or ``asyncio.to_thread``.

    NOTE: the ``generate`` cost-tracking seam is currently exercised only by the
    document/batch induction paths, which do not yet thread a CostTracker in —
    wiring those callers is tracked as a follow-up (document-path metering).

"""Unit tests for the Snowflake integ suite's failure classifier.

The classifier decides whether a red Snowflake integ run is a REGRESSION or a
dead trial account, so getting it wrong is expensive in both directions: too
broad and it swallows the defects the suite exists to catch, too narrow and the
pipeline reports a code failure nobody can fix. It is pure string logic, so it
is tested here (CI runs only ``tests/unit``) rather than left to a run that
needs a live Snowflake account.

"""Per-engine database adapters for the direct-JDBC serve path.

The direct-JDBC executor (``clients/source_db.py``) delegates every
engine-specific decision to an :class:`EngineAdapter`. Each supported engine has
exactly one adapter that co-locates:

- the connection transport (SQLAlchemy async engine for wire-protocol drivers,
  or a synchronous driver wrapped in ``asyncio.to_thread`` — e.g. python-tds for
  SQL Server),
- the sqlglot dialect used to parse/transpile SQL for that engine,
- the per-transaction session settings (statement timeout, search_path, ...),
- the row-limit injection idiom (``LIMIT`` vs ``TOP``).

The executor holds NO engine ``if`` branches: it resolves ONE adapter via
:func:`get_adapter` and calls the abstract methods. Adding a new engine is a new
adapter subclass plus one registry entry — no executor edit.

``ConnHandle`` is the opaque connection object an adapter caches and later runs
queries against; its concrete type is private to each adapter (a SQLAlchemy
``AsyncEngine`` for the asyncpg/aiomysql adapters, a connection factory for the
python-tds adapter). The executor treats it as opaque.

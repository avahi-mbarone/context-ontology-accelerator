"""Per-engine direct-JDBC adapter registry.

Public surface:
- :class:`EngineAdapter`, :class:`DBCredentials`, ``ConnHandle`` — the abstraction.
- :func:`get_adapter` — resolve the adapter for an engine token, fail-safe to
  PostgreSQL (preserves the historical "default postgres" behavior for an unknown
  or missing engine so an unexpected value can never break an existing source).

Adding a new engine: implement an ``EngineAdapter`` subclass in a new module and
add one instance to ``_ADAPTERS`` below. No change to the executor.

Engines without a direct adapter here (Snowflake, Oracle) are served through
Athena federation; :func:`is_direct_query_engine` keeps them off the direct-JDBC
route so they can never be executed through the PostgreSQL fail-safe with the
wrong SQL dialect.

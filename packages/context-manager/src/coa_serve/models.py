        contract-conformant caller reaches ``.items()`` with a list and gets
        ``AttributeError`` → a blanket 500.

        Normalizing here rather than deeper in keeps the conversion at the one
        boundary where the wire shape is known and is shared by BOTH callers (the
        Data Layer REST handler and the Playground SSE path, which construct the
        same ``InvokeRequest``). ``substitute_dimensions`` keeps its dict contract.

        A malformed payload raises ``ValueError`` → ``ValidationError`` → the
        existing 400 path in ``main.py``, so bad input is a client error rather
        than an ``AttributeError`` surfacing as "Query resolution failed".

        A dict is also accepted — it is the shape internal callers and the existing
        unit tests pass, and BOTH transports can carry one (the SSE path forwards
        ``options`` verbatim, and the REST handler forwards a top-level
        ``dimensions`` object unchanged; nothing schema-checks it upstream, as there
        is no API Gateway request validator). It therefore gets the SAME per-entry
        checks as the list shape rather than a free pass: a dict that skipped them

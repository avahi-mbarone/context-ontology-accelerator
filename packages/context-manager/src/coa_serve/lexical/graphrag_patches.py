"""Serve-side graphrag-toolkit patch: request ``embedding`` in ``_source``.

Why this exists
---------------
``TopicBeamSearch`` expands the beam by fetching each neighbour topic's *stored*
embedding by id (``topic_beam_search.py:148`` -> ``OpenSearchIndex.get_embeddings``
-> ``get_all_embeddings`` -> ``paginated_search``). The toolkit's
``_to_get_embedding_result`` then reads ``source['embedding']``
(``opensearch_vector_indexes.py:643``) with a bare subscript.

On AOSS **NEXTGEN** collections the ``knn_vector`` field is NOT returned in the
default ``_source`` projection, so that subscript raises ``KeyError: 'embedding'``.
The exception escapes ``get_embeddings`` and is swallowed one level up by
``TopicBeamSearch._get_embeddings``' broad ``except Exception`` (logged only as
``Failed to fetch stored topic embeddings``). Every neighbour is then treated as
"no stored embedding" and skipped, so the beam collapses to its seed set and the
retriever returns ~1 node regardless of how good the seeds are.

Measured on the live sec10q collection: a terms query for known topic ids matches
3/3 docs but ``'embedding' in hit['_source']`` is ``False``; adding an explicit
``_source`` include returns the full 1024-dim vector for 5681/5681 topic docs.

The fix: explicitly project the fields ``_to_get_embedding_result`` consumes. This
is a read-path-only patch (serve never writes vectors), and it leaves the
``ids_only`` branch untouched since that path deliberately suppresses ``_source``.

Reported upstream; remove this module once the toolkit projects the vector field
itself. Applied lazily (never at import) to preserve the botocore sync-only
invariant documented in ``strategies.py``.

"""Shared execute-with-authz primitive — the firewall + executor pair, composed once.

Every path that runs generated SQL needs the same two steps in the same order:
the :class:`~coa_serve.tier2.sql_firewall.SQLFirewall` gate (structural safety
plus grant/Cedar authorization), then :meth:`QueryExecutor.execute`. This module
composes exactly that pair, so no caller needs an arbitrary-SQL execution entry
point of its own — in particular the NL→SQL agent
(:mod:`coa_serve.agents.sql_agent`) runs its generated queries through here
instead of exposing a raw ``run_sql`` tool to the model.

It sits UNDER the tiers: it holds no retrieval, no generation and no prompt, and
never decides WHAT to run — it only refuses or runs the statement it is handed.

Error contract (deliberately different from the client protocols in
:mod:`coa_serve.clients.base`, which raise): expected failures — structurally
unsafe SQL, a policy denial, an engine error — come back as a
:class:`SqlExecutionOutcome` with a non-OK :class:`SqlExecutionStatus` rather
than as an exception, because the callers are self-correcting loops that must
feed the observation back into the next generation. Which statuses are terminal
is the caller's decision: the agent path raises ``AccessDeniedError`` for a
denial once its loop has finished, mirroring ``NLtoSQLStrategy``.

"""Execution mode — the request-level policy axis, orthogonal to tiers.

Why this exists
---------------
"Tier" conflates two unrelated things. It is a **routing cascade** (try metrics,
then NL→SQL, then RAG) *and* it is used as the name of the *engine* that answers
(``tier3Mode``). That made the agentic engine look like a Tier-3 implementation
detail, when it is really a different way of executing *any* request.

This module separates the axes:

* **MODE** — *how* to execute: single-shot (``standard``) or an iterative
  plan/act/assess loop (``agentic``). Caller-controllable.
* **COMPOSITION** — *what* the namespace holds (structured / unstructured /
  mixed). Derived from the sources registry, never caller-settable.
* **TIER** — retained purely as a label for the *shape* of the answer that came
  back (1 = metric, 2 = rows, 3 = prose), which is all it ever actually meant on
  the response.

Mode and composition together select a retrieval plan; the tier cascade still
decides *which* answer shape wins. A namespace with no documents cannot run a
document retriever in either mode, and a namespace with no database cannot run
NL→SQL in either mode — that is composition's job, not mode's.

Scope note: this module is deliberately inert — it defines and resolves the
contract only. Nothing here changes which engine runs; ``resolve_mode`` reproduces
the existing ``_is_agentic_engaged`` precedence exactly (request over deployment
default), so wiring it in is a provable no-op. Behavior changes land in the
follow-ups that consume :class:`ResolutionPlan`.

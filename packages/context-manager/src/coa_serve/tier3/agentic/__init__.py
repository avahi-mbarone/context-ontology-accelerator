"""Tier 3 — Agentic Retriever subpackage.

A server-side reasoning agent that iteratively explores the graphrag-toolkit
knowledge graph through an internal-only tool set, then synthesizes a
best-effort answer via the existing guardrailed ``Synthesizer``.

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): module load of this subpackage MUST NOT
import ``graphrag_toolkit``. All toolkit access is delegated to the already-lazy
``BaselineLexicalRetriever`` / ``STRATEGY_REGISTRY`` ``build_engine`` callables,
imported lazily inside the tool ``invoke`` methods — never at module load. This
``__init__`` therefore exports only the dependency-free shared data models; the
heavier components (controller, tools, retriever) are imported directly from
their own modules by the factory to keep this package's load cheap and lazy.

"""The Agentic Retriever session orchestration (Req 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13).

:class:`AgenticRetriever` is the Tier 3 agentic path. It owns one **reasoning
session** per request and returns the existing frozen
:class:`~coa_serve.tier3.knowledge_retriever.Tier3Result`, so
``Orchestrator._run_tier3`` and ``ResponseAssembler.assemble_tier3`` consume its
output unchanged (design tenet 1). A session:

1. starts a single :class:`BudgetClock` and a single
   :class:`AccumulatedContext`, both **shared** across every Sub_Question and
   Exploration_Branch so the Time_Budget, the max-step cap, and the fan-out cap
   are enforced in aggregate for the whole request (Req 13.9);
2. decomposes the input question into one or more Sub_Questions via the
   :class:`DecompositionPlanner` (Req 13.1-13.3);
3. drives the Sub_Question / Exploration_Branch FIFO queue through the
   :class:`ReasoningController`, one loop per queued item, until the queue drains
   or the wall-clock Time_Budget expires (Req 4, 6, 7.4-7.5);
4. derives exactly one terminal stop reason from the :class:`StopReason` enum
   (Req 6.6) and records it; and
5. synthesizes once over the merged accumulated context via the existing
   guardrailed :class:`Synthesizer` (Req 8.1).

The session sets ``partial`` on the time-budget-expiry, all-tools-fail, and
degraded-source paths (Req 7.5-7.8, 9.6-9.7); populates ``supporting_content`` /
``graph_context`` from the accumulated context (empty when nothing was gathered,
Req 8.2); honors a guardrail block (Req 8.3-8.4) and a synthesis failure
(Req 8.6); and scopes every Tool invocation, Sub_Question, and Exploration_Branch
to the originating request Namespace, blocking and tracing any cross-Namespace
access (Req 1.5, 1.7).

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): this module imports only dependency-free
siblings (the budget clock, the accumulated context, the shared models) and the
graphrag-free :class:`Tier3Result` at load. The
controller, decomposer, synthesizer, registry, embed client, and trace collector
are referenced structurally and typed under ``TYPE_CHECKING``, so importing this
module never pulls ``graphrag_toolkit`` into ``sys.modules``.

    :meth:`resolve`, so the retriever itself is stateless and safe to share.

    Args:
        registry: The internal :class:`ToolRegistry` the controller selects Tools
            from. Never exposed outside the Serve_Layer (Req 2.7).
        controller: The :class:`ReasoningController` that drives one

        decomposer: The :class:`DecompositionPlanner` that splits the input

        synthesizer: The existing guardrailed :class:`Synthesizer` used for the

        embed_client: Optional planner/embedding :class:`LLMClient`. Held for
            parity with the design and for tools that embed sub-question text; the
            session orchestration itself does not call it directly.
        clock_source: Monotonic time source (seconds) injected into the per-request
            :class:`BudgetClock`. Defaults to :func:`time.monotonic`; tests inject
            a manually advanced source to drive time deterministically.
        final_semantic_search: When ``True`` (default), the session ALWAYS runs a
            standard ``strategy:chunk_based_semantic`` search of the original query
            as a final step (after the reasoning loop, before synthesis), so every

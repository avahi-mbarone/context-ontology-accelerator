"""Prepared, parameterized graph-query templates for the Agentic Retriever.

A Query_Template is a *prepared* retrieval pattern the agent fills in rather than
authoring a graph query from scratch (Req 5). Preferring a template over an
Ad_Hoc_Query keeps graph retrieval reliable and avoids query-generation errors
(Req 5.1-5.3). This module owns the templates the ``Graph_Traversal_Tool`` runs,
including the one required by Requirement 5.5 — the edge-typed traversal.

Which graph these target (load-bearing — see the design's "Two graphs")
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These are **openCypher** templates over the graphrag-toolkit **property graph**
(the graph kg-build populates in Neptune Database), NOT SPARQL over the RDF
ontology graph. They are executed through the toolkit ``GraphStore`` (which
speaks openCypher to Neptune), never through the serve layer's SPARQL
``GraphTraverser``/``NeptuneGraphClient``.

Property-graph schema these templates assume (verified against the toolkit
``EntityGraphBuilder`` / ``EntityRelationGraphBuilder`` / ``StatementGraphBuilder``):

- Entity node label ``__Entity__``, **tenant-scoped** — the caller formats it via
  ``TenantId(tenant).format_label("__Entity__")`` and passes the already
  backtick-wrapped label as ``entity_label``. The entity's ``entityId`` is stored
  as the Neptune node id, so entities are matched/returned with ``id(...)`` (true
  for both Neptune Database and Neptune Analytics, which both key entities by
  ``~id``).
- Entity properties: ``value`` (display name) and ``class`` (classification).
- Entity↔entity relations: ``(:__Entity__)-[r:`__RELATION__` {value: <predicate>}]-(:__Entity__)``.
  There is a single relationship type ``__RELATION__``; the edge type is the
  ``value`` property on it (an LLM-extracted predicate string).
- Connected-node text: an entity's supporting statements are reached via
  ``(:__Entity__)-[:`__SUBJECT__`|`__OBJECT__`]->()-[:`__SUPPORTS__`]->(:__Statement__)``;
  the statement text is the ``__Statement__.value`` property. The statement label
  is also tenant-scoped (``statement_label``).

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): this module is dependency-free — it holds
only template strings, bound constants, and a normalization helper, and never
imports ``graphrag_toolkit`` (nor anything that does), so importing it never pulls
the toolkit into ``sys.modules``.

Parameter discipline: entity ids and edge types are passed to Neptune as
openCypher **query parameters** (``$entity_ids``, ``$edge_types_norm``,
``$terms``) — never interpolated into the query text — so there is no
query-injection surface. Only the tenant-scoped labels (derived internally, never
from caller input) and the integer ``limit`` are formatted into the query text.

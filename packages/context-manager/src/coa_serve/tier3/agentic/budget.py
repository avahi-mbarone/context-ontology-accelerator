"""Aggregate budget and clock manager for the Agentic Retriever.

A single :class:`BudgetClock` is created per reasoning session and shared across
every Sub_Question and Exploration_Branch so that the wall-clock Time_Budget, the
maximum number of Reasoning_Steps, and the fan-out cap are all enforced **in
aggregate** for the whole request rather than per-branch (Requirements 4.4-4.5,
6.4, 7.1, 7.3, 13.7-13.9).

The clock is driven by an **injectable** monotonic time source (a callable
returning seconds, defaulting to :func:`time.monotonic`). Injecting the clock lets
tests drive time deterministically without sleeping.

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): this module is dependency-free and never
imports ``graphrag_toolkit``.

    This is a plain value object; range validation and env-var parsing live in
    the service configuration loader (task 15). Here the values are simply held
    and read by the :class:`BudgetClock`. The defaults match the documented
    deployment defaults (Req 4.4 default 10 steps, Req 7.2 default 30s budget,
    Req 9.4 default 30s per-tool timeout, Req 13.7 default fan-out 5).

    Attributes:
        time_budget_s: Wall-clock limit for the Reasoning_Loop, in whole seconds
            (Req 7.1, range 1-300 enforced at config load).
        max_steps: Maximum number of Reasoning_Steps per request (Req 4.4 / 6.4,
            range 1-50 enforced at config load).
        per_tool_timeout_s: Per-Tool invocation timeout, in seconds (Req 9.3-9.4,
            range 1-120 enforced at config load).
        max_fanout: Maximum number of Sub_Questions plus Exploration_Branches in
            aggregate (Req 13.7-13.8, range 1-20 enforced at config load).
        synthesis_reserve_s: Wall-clock slice reserved at the END of the session
            for the final synthesis Converse call, in seconds. Tool invocations are
            clamped so they cannot consume it (see :meth:`BudgetClock.tool_deadline_s`),

"""Retrieval_Strategy_Tool: one Tool per graphrag-toolkit RetrieverStrategy.

Each :class:`RetrievalStrategyTool` wraps the existing, already-lazy
``BaselineLexicalRetriever`` adapter and invokes exactly one of the seven
registered graphrag-toolkit ``RetrieverStrategy`` options (Req 2.2, 5.1). The
builder :func:`build_strategy_tools` registers one Tool per enum member, named
``strategy:<value>`` (e.g. ``strategy:entity_network``).

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): module load of this module MUST NOT import
``graphrag_toolkit`` — nor anything from the ``coa_serve.lexical``
package, whose ``__init__`` imports the toolkit eagerly. Accordingly:

- the per-strategy descriptions are keyed by the strategy's **string value**, so
  no enum import is needed at module load;
- ``BaselineLexicalRetriever`` / ``RetrieverStrategy`` / ``StrategySpec`` are
  referenced only under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` for typing;
- the only access to ``STRATEGY_REGISTRY`` is a **lazy import inside**
  :meth:`RetrievalStrategyTool.invoke`; the enum is imported lazily inside
  :func:`build_strategy_tools`.

Per-Tool failure tolerance (Req 9.1-9.2): the wrapped adapter already degrades to
an empty result with an error trace step on timeout/error and never raises, so a
strategy Tool invocation likewise never raises — it returns a (possibly empty)
:class:`ToolResult` whose ``detail`` records any degradation for the controller.

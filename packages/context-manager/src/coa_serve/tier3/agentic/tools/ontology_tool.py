"""Ontology_Lookup_Tool: the determined ontology for the request namespace (Req 3.1).

:class:`OntologyLookupTool` exposes the determined ontology — the complete set of
node types, the complete set of edge types, and the directional source→target
mapping per edge type (Req 3.1) — through the uniform :class:`Tool` contract, so
the reasoning controller invokes it the same way as every other Tool. It resolves
the ontology through a configurable :class:`OntologySource` (graph or file) and
returns the result in one source-agnostic shape regardless of which backend
resolved it (Req 3.6).

Stopgap scope. The tool currently returns the WHOLE determined ontology in a
single result — the wholesale-copy stopgap the retriever ships on today (the file
source materializes the entire ontology; see ``..ontology.source``). Follow-up
task 21 will allow query-shaped lookups against the live ontology graph instead
of copying it wholesale; the Tool contract here is shaped so that capability is
purely ADDITIVE (an item-carrying :class:`ToolResult` plus the namespace-scoped
invoke already accommodate narrower, input-driven queries), so no behavior here
changes for that follow-up.

Per-request caching (Req 3.8). The tool caches the resolved ontology keyed by
namespace, so a second lookup within the same request — which is always scoped to a
single namespace — reuses the cached ontology and performs a SINGLE source load.
The cache scope is the Tool instance: the registry (and therefore each Tool) is
built once and reused across requests, so a namespace-keyed cache gives the
required per-request reuse while remaining correct across requests for the same
namespace (the determined ontology is a slowly-changing per-namespace schema, not
per-request state). Only POPULATED loads are cached — a load failure OR an empty
ontology is never cached, so a later request (once the namespace's ontology is
induced/accepted, or a transient backend recovers) re-queries and self-heals. The
controller additionally caches the ontology on its accumulated context so it need
not re-invoke this tool at all within a request (Req 3.8); the tool-level cache is
the defensive second layer that keeps a redundant invocation cheap.

Empty result vs load failure are distinct outcomes (Req 3.10 vs 3.11). A successful
load that yields no node types and no edge types is an EMPTY ontology: the tool
returns a normal (non-degraded) :class:`ToolResult` carrying an ontology item with
empty type sets and a ``detail`` that says ``empty``. A source that RAISES is a load
FAILURE: the tool catches it (it never lets the exception escape ``invoke`` —
Req 9.1) and returns a degraded :class:`ToolResult` carrying NO ontology item and a
``detail`` that says ``failed`` and names the source in use. The two are
programmatically separable via :func:`ontology_from_result`, which returns an
:class:`Ontology` (possibly empty) for a successful lookup and ``None`` for a
failure, giving the controller a clean signal to record the empty result (Req 3.10)
or the failure-plus-source (Req 3.11) in the trace.

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): module load imports only the dependency-free
``.base`` contract and the sibling ``..ontology`` abstraction (which itself imports
``rdflib`` lazily and never imports ``graphrag_toolkit``) plus ``structlog``, so
importing this module never pulls the toolkit into ``sys.modules``.

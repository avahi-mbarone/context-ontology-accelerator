"""Structured-retrieval tools for the Agentic Retriever (NL→SQL and NL→SPARQL).

Wraps the existing :class:`StructuredQueryTier` — the same engine the standard
Tier-2 path uses — and exposes its TWO strategies to the reasoning loop as separate
Tools that produce on the ``rows`` channel of :class:`ToolResult`:

  * ``nl_to_sql``    → ``NLtoSQLStrategy``: NL→SQL directly over the mapped tables.
  * ``nl_to_sparql`` → ``OntopStrategy``: NL→SPARQL over the ontology/VKG, which
    Ontop rewrites to SQL.

They are separate tools because they are genuinely different capabilities and the
planner should be able to pick the ontology path on purpose. ``StructuredQueryTier``
already supports this via its ``option`` kwarg, so each tool just pins its own.
This is what lets the agentic loop answer a structured sub-question (e.g. "what was
revenue in Q3?") against a DATABASE source instead of only retrieving document chunks.

Composition gating (Req: "don't present structured tools when there is no
structured source") is PER-REQUEST, not at registration: the factory registers
these tools process-wide whenever a ``StructuredQueryTier`` exists, and the
retriever withholds them from the planner's spec list on a namespace with no
structured source (``_STRUCTURED_TOOL_NAMES`` -> ``excluded_tools`` ->
``registry.specs(exclude=...)``). The tools themselves never see composition; they
always attempt the query they are given.

The per-request ``profile`` / ``options`` / ``model_id`` reach ``invoke`` OUT-OF-BAND
from the controller, NOT through the planner's tool inputs: identity is not the
LLM's to supply, and ``validate_inputs`` rejects any key outside a tool's
``input_schema`` anyway. The profile is load-bearing — SQLFirewall/Cedar fail
CLOSED when no roles resolve, so an empty profile turns every invocation into an
``AccessDeniedError`` that the blanket ``except`` renders as a plain retrieval miss.

Per-Tool failure tolerance (Req 9.1-9.2): like every Tool, ``invoke`` never
raises for a retrieval failure. ``StructuredQueryTier.resolve`` returns ``None``
when no strategy produced a confident answer; the tool maps that to an empty
:class:`ToolResult` whose ``detail`` records the miss, so the controller scores it
as no-progress and can escalate, exactly as an empty document retrieval would.

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): this module imports only the dependency-free
Tool base and, lazily inside ``invoke``, the Tier-2 strategy context — never
``graphrag_toolkit``.

        What the embedding actually buys (measured against the code, not assumed):
        Ontop skips its vector-hit lookup entirely without one, which costs the
        metric context, the ``:aiContext`` glossary, and the confidence-calibration
        signal. It does NOT change the class/property T-Box for namespaces at or
        under the 200-mapped-class full-context threshold — that path is
        vector-independent. Note the calibration loss cuts both ways: with no hits
        neither the strong-hit boost nor the weak-hit penalty applies, so an
        ungrounded SPARQL can score HIGHER than it deserves.

        For ``nl_to_sql`` this relocates an embed rather than saving one
        (``SQLGenerator`` self-embeds otherwise) — but relocating it is still worth
        it, because an embed failure inside ``SQLGenerator`` is terminal for the

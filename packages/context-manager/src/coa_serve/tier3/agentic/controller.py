"""Reasoning controller: drives one Sub_Question's Reasoning_Loop (Req 4, 5, 6).

:class:`ReasoningController` owns the per-Sub_Question / per-Exploration_Branch
loop that sits at the heart of the Agentic Retriever. One iteration of the loop is
a single Reasoning_Step (Req 4.1): it consumes a step from the shared
:class:`~coa_serve.tier3.agentic.budget.BudgetClock`, asks the planner
for the next Tool + inputs, validates those inputs against the Tool's declared
input contract, invokes the Tool under the per-Tool timeout, incorporates the
result into the shared accumulated context, opens Exploration_Branches when a
result surfaces multiple directions, and runs the boolean Sufficiency_Check
(Req 4.2-4.3, 6.1-6.3).

The controller does NOT own the session: the wall-clock Time_Budget, the
aggregate step cap, and the fan-out cap all live on the single
:class:`BudgetClock` the session shares across every Sub_Question and
Exploration_Branch, and the queue of Sub_Questions is owned by the session too.
The controller merely draws from those shared budgets and appends branches to the
shared queue, which is what makes the caps aggregate for the whole request
(Req 13.7-13.9). The terminal session stop reason and the final synthesis are the
session's job (tasks 13-14); :meth:`ReasoningController.run_one_loop` returns the
per-Sub_Question outcome so the session can derive the session-level stop.

Tool preference (Req 5.1-5.3, 5.6). The planner proposes one or more candidate
decisions; the controller enforces the hard preference ordering **itself**,
deterministically, regardless of the order the planner returned them: a
Retrieval_Strategy_Tool is preferred over a Query_Template, which is preferred over
an Ad_Hoc_Query (strategy wins ties — Req 5.6). An Ad_Hoc_Query is therefore only
ever selected when it is the sole candidate (Req 5.3); when one is used the
controller records that no strategy tool / template fit (Req 5.4) and handles an
ad-hoc execution failure distinctly (Req 5.7).

Ontology-constrained traversal (Req 3.4, 3.9). When a selected decision traverses
edge types and the ontology has already been resolved for the request, the
controller filters the requested edge types down to the ontology's edge-type set,
excluding any absent ones, before the Tool is invoked.

Import discipline (Requirement 12.3): this module imports only the dependency-free
sibling models / context and ``structlog``; it never imports ``graphrag_toolkit``
nor any tool implementation (the registry and Tools are passed in at call time and
used structurally), so importing it never pulls the toolkit into ``sys.modules``.

"""NL→SQL agent — a bounded, self-correcting Strands agent over the Tier-2 tools.

Where the single-shot Tier-2 path does a fixed retrieve → generate → (correct)
pipeline, this agent *iteratively* discovers the right tables (searching, then
inspecting candidate schemas and their FKs) before writing SQL, then executes and
self-corrects. On the multi-source Spider 2.0 regime that iterative schema
inspection is the main lever over single-shot retrieval.

This module is only the WIRING: it owns the prompt and the turn-by-turn
translation between the model and the capabilities it may use. It owns no
retrieval, no SQL generation and no execution of its own —

  * ``search_tables`` / ``get_table_schema`` → :class:`TableCatalog` (Tier 2)
  * ``generate_sql``                        → :class:`SqlAuthoringTool` (Tier 2)
  * ``explore_graph`` (opt-in)              → :class:`OntologyGraphTool` (Tier 2)
  * ``execute_sql``                         → :class:`SqlExecutionService`

— so the agent is one consumer of the shared tools rather than their owner, and
the same tools back any other consumer (an MCP tool, an HTTP route) unchanged.

**No arbitrary SQL execution.** The agent never gets a "run this SQL" tool. Every
statement it can execute must have come from ``generate_sql``, which returns an
opaque HANDLE; ``execute_sql`` takes only that handle and runs the corresponding
statement through the shared execute-with-authz primitive (firewall + executor).
Self-correction is unaffected: the execute step returns rows or the engine error,
which feeds the next ``generate_sql`` as revise-feedback.

It runs natively async (Strands ``Agent.invoke_async``) inside the orchestrator's
event loop, with async tools backed by the SAME serve clients the other Tier-2
strategies use — no sources-API, no separate infra.

**What bounds the loop.** Not a turn count: the orchestrator's request deadline
(``RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_S``) and the per-statement execution timeout
(:data:`_DEFAULT_EXEC_TIMEOUT_S`) are the real bounds, and a turn cap is
therefore not offered — see the note on ``invoke_async`` below.

AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a SQL expert answering a question against a relational database you must \
discover through tools. Workflow:
1. The prompt may already list candidate tables and inline the schema of the most \
likely ones. START FROM WHAT IS GIVEN — call search_tables only when the question \
needs a table that is not there, or the given candidates are clearly wrong.
2. Call get_table_schema on any table you will use whose schema is not already \
inlined (inspect columns, types, foreign-key relationships, and any 'allowed \
values'). Do NOT guess columns.
3. Call generate_sql with the exact table names you chose — a focused SQL writer \
produces the query from those tables' schema. Do NOT write SQL yourself.
4. Call execute_sql with the handle generate_sql returned to run that query.
5. If execute_sql returns an error, call generate_sql again (optionally inspect more \
schema first) and execute the new handle. If it returns zero rows and the question \
expects data, reconsider which tables/filters are right and try again.
6. When execute_sql succeeds with the intended result, output the FINAL SQL in <sql>...</sql> tags.

Rules:
- ALWAYS get SQL from generate_sql — never hand-write SQL in your reasoning.
- ALWAYS verify with execute_sql before finishing.
- execute_sql runs ONLY a query generate_sql produced: pass the handle, not SQL text.
- PRECISION: most questions need 1-3 tables. Don't over-retrieve; pick the minimal set.
- The candidate tables may span several unrelated databases; only join tables that \
share a real foreign key. Ignore irrelevant candidates.
- Output the final verified SQL in <sql>...</sql>."""


# Appended to the system prompt ONLY when SERVE_AGENTIC_INTENT_REVIEW is on. Targets
# the confidently-wrong-on-plausible-rows failure mode: the agent runs SQL, sees
# non-empty rows, and finalizes without questioning whether its reading of the
# question's ambiguous terms is the intended one. This adds a mandatory
# interpretation-reconciliation turn BEFORE finalizing — model-driven, no rule
# catalogue. Safe by construction on this path: the last successful SQL is sticky,
# so a re-run during review cannot downgrade an already-good answer to empty.
INTENT_REVIEW_BLOCK = """

BEFORE you output the final <sql>, run this interpretation check (it is NOT optional):
- Re-read the question and list every term that could be read more than one way: \
quantifiers ("highest X, Y and Z" — does it mean rows maximal in ALL of them, in ANY \
one, or ranked by a combination?), metric definitions (how EXACTLY is the rate / \
span / lifespan / average computed, and over what grain — per row, per group, \
distinct?), filters implied but not stated (status, date window, de-duplication), \
and the requested output shape (one number vs a list, rounding, units).
- For the reading your current SQL encodes, state in one line why it is the reading \
the question intends. If a DIFFERENT reading is at least as plausible, generate_sql \
for that reading, execute_sql it, and compare the two results before choosing.
- Only then output the final verified SQL in <sql>...</sql>."""


# NO PROMPT BLOCK FOR explore_graph — deliberately.
#
# An earlier revision appended a paragraph describing the tool and MANDATING it
# ("you MUST call explore_graph before generate_sql"). Strands already passes each
# tool's docstring to the model, so that was a SECOND description of the same tool,
# and repetition in a prompt is itself a nudge: the agent called it on 81 of 135
# Spider 2.0 questions for +1.1pp EX (p=0.69), i.e. it fired everywhere and paid for
# itself nowhere. Trajectories show why — hop-1 FK neighbours are already in the text
# ``get_table_schema`` returns, so most calls re-fetched context the agent had.
#
# Keeping the prompt byte-identical whether or not the tool is wired also makes the
# flag a clean A/B: the only difference between arms is the tool's availability, and
# whether the model reaches for it on its own merits is then a real signal. If call
# volume drops to zero, the follow-up is one line on WHEN it earns its cost (a join
# the search missed), never a re-description of what it does.

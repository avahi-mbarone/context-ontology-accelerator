"""Pluggable Tier-2 skip evaluators.

A ``Tier2SkipEvaluator`` lets the orchestrator prune the Tier-2 structured-query
path for a query it provably cannot answer — WITHOUT the orchestrator owning any
of the detection logic. The evaluator is injected optionally; when absent, the
orchestrator behaves exactly as before (no extra work, no behavior change).

See ``evaluator.py`` for the interface and the fail-open contract, and
``aoss_provenance.py`` for the AOSS mapped-class-provenance provider.

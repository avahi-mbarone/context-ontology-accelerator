"""Tier-2 skip evaluator interface and decision type.

A ``Tier2SkipEvaluator`` answers ONE narrow question for a single query:

    "Can Tier 2 (the structured NL→SQL/SPARQL path) be pruned for this query
     because it provably cannot contribute — routing it AWAY, not routing it TO?"

The contract is deliberately conservative and **fail-open**: an evaluator returns
``SKIP`` only on positive proof that Tier 2 is useless, ``RUN`` when there is
positive evidence it could contribute, and ``ABSTAIN`` on ANY uncertainty. The
orchestrator treats both ``RUN`` and ``ABSTAIN`` as "run Tier 2 as normal" — so a
mistaken or unavailable evaluator can never drop a tier that would have answered.

"""AOSS mapped-class-provenance Tier-2 skip evaluator.

Prunes the Tier-2 structured-query path for a **document-flavored query inside a
MIXED namespace** — the one gap namespace-level source-composition gating leaves
open (a mixed namespace has a DATABASE source, so that gating runs Tier 2).

Signal (subtractive, capability-based — NOT intent classification):
    An ontology class carries a ``data_source_id`` in AOSS *iff* it is R2RML-mapped
    to a relational source (the field is stamped only on the structured induction
    path). So ``data_source_id`` presence == "Tier-2-capable". If the classes a
    query retrieves are ALL unmapped (empty ``data_source_id``), Tier 2 cannot
    generate SQL from them → prune it.

Guardrails (fail-open — see ``Tier2SkipDecision``):
  * Only runs for MIXED namespaces (≥1 DATABASE and ≥1 DOCUMENTS source). Pure
    namespaces are already decided deterministically by namespace-level gating;
    running here would add an AOSS search with nothing to gain.
  * ``tierOverride`` / no embedding / no vector client / unconfigured index →
    ABSTAIN.
  * "All top-k unmapped" is only trusted when there is positive evidence the
    namespace actually stamps provenance — i.e. at least one class in the
    (over-fetched) result set IS mapped. Otherwise the all-empty result is
    ambiguous (a namespace whose ontology predates the ``data_source_id`` field is
    also all-empty) and we ABSTAIN rather than risk dropping a valid structured
    answer.
  * Any error is swallowed → ABSTAIN.

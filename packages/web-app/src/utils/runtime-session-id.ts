 *
 * The `NNN-` length prefix is what makes the encoding injective, and it is not

 * `"noah0000…"`, which would put two distinct users on ONE AgentCore session.
 * With the prefix, `sub` is recoverable from the output (declared length, then
 * that many characters), so distinct subs cannot share a session id.
 *
 * Applied to every `sub`, not just short ones: a long `sub` that happened to
 * equal some short `sub`'s padded form would collide the same way.

/**
 * Playwright configuration for the Context Ontology Accelerator web-app E2E suite.
 *
 * Topology:
 *   - "setup"  runs auth.setup.ts once, persisting a storageState to .auth/user.json
 *   - "auth"   tests the login gate itself (no stored state)
 *   - feature-area projects depend on "setup" and reuse the stored state
 *
 * The base URL comes from E2E_BASE_URL (CI passes the deployed environment URL),
 * defaulting to the local Vite dev server. Credentials are read from the
 * environment by the fixtures; when absent, environment-dependent tests skip.
 *
 * Paths are relative to this config file (no __dirname — the package is ESM).

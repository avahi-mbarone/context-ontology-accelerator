 * NOT by the caller's own membership in `DataLakeAdmins`. This works unattended on
 * any account, greenfield or with admins already present, and needs no
 * out-of-band bootstrap. An earlier version of this comment claimed the caller
 * had to be a data-lake admin itself; that was verified false by direct test (a
 * non-admin role with only the two `*DataLakeSettings` permissions modified the
 * admin list on an account with four existing admins). An `AccessDeniedException`
 * here means the IAM action is denied — look for an SCP or permission boundary.
